# Project: Weather App using openweathermap API

Hi!

This app uses the fetch API in JavaScript and the openweathermap API to reques weather data in diferent cities.
The aim of the project is to use promises, in particular, Async/Await notation.

I've done this project as a part of JavaScript Fullstack curriculum of [The Oding Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/).
